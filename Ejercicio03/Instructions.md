# Stock Analysis Program

This program provides functionalities to analyze stock prices, including calculating the average price, finding the maximum price, counting occurrences of a specific price, and computing the cumulative sum of stock prices.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files (`StockAnalysis.java`).
4. Compile the Java file using the following command:

    ```
    javac StockAnalysis.java
    ```

5. After successful compilation, run the program using the following command:

    ```
    java StockAnalysis
    ```

6. The program will execute and display the results of the stock analysis tasks.

## Usage

- The program takes an array of stock prices as input and performs various analyses on it.
- The main method in `StockAnalysis.java` demonstrates how to use the implemented methods with sample data.

## Methods Implemented

1. `calculateAveragePrice`: Calculates the average stock price.
2. `findMaximumPrice`: Finds the maximum stock price.
3. `countOccurrences`: Determines the occurrence count of a specific price.
4. `computeCumulativeSum`: Computes the cumulative sum of stock prices.

## Additional Notes

- The program uses loops (for, while) for both arrays and ArrayLists, as per the requirements.
- Ensure that both the array and ArrayList of stock prices are not null and contain at least one element.
